I've created this organisation to connect people I know working on malaria recurrent state statistical genetic inference including 

* Plasmodium falciparum recrudescence and reinfection (Pf2R) inference
* Plasmodium vivax relapse, recrudescence and reinfection (Pf3R) inference

For the time-being, it is basically a placeholder for something that could become more elaborate later. The logo (a very quick draft sketch), is meant to be a boomerang with a hypnozoite, red blood cell, and mosquito representing relapse, recrudescence and reinfection.
